Quize:

1) 
words = 'ant bear cat dog beer'
B = words.split()
What is B?

2) 
def SelectWord(wordList, i):
     word = wordList[i]
     return word
A = ['ant', 'bear', 'cat', 'dog', 'beer' ]
w = SelectWord(A, 2)
What is w?

3)
missedLetters = ['a', 'c', 't']
for letter in missedLetters:
    print(letter)
What is the output?

4) 
blanks = '_' * 3
What is blanks?

5)
for i in range(5):
   print(i)
What is the output?

6)
while True:
    myInput = input('Input something to get out of the loop')
    if myInput == 'no':
       break;
When you run the above code, the program will run forever. How do you get out of the loop?

7)
import random
x = random.randint(0, 5)
What is the possible value of x? 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,100?

6)
def getGuess(alreadyGuessed, w):
    if len(guess) != 1:
        print('Please enter a single letter.')
    elif guess in alreadyGuessed:
        print('You have already guessed that letter.')
    elif guess not in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
        print('Please enter a LETTER.')
    else:
        alreadyGuessed = alreadyGuessed.append(w)
    return alreadyGuessed

mylist = ['a','b','c','d']
B = getGuess(mylist, 'a'), what is B?
B = getGuess(mylist, 'e'), What is B?
B = getGuess(mylist, '1'), What is B?
B = getGuess(mylist, 'something'), What is B?
