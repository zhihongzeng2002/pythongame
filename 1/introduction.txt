Class Description:

Playing video game is one of the most entertaining activities for kids and teenages, even adults. Curiosity of how a game is implemented and doing it yourself (DIY) provide a fascinating learning opportunity.

1) In the fall semester class, students are going to learn basics of Python (e.g., expressions, data types, variables, lists, dictionaries, flow control, functions and class) and explore python games by writing/debugging/playing small text-based games. The list of games include but not limited as:

Guess the number
Jokes
Dragon Realm
Hangman
Tic Tac Toe
Bagels
Reversi ...

2) In the spring semester class, students are going to make graphical games with the Pygame framework. They will learn some advanced programming skills, such as drawing, event handling, game window and camera view. The list of games include:

Boucing Ball
Memory puzzle
Wormy game which evolves from a simple game to a complex game, i.e.,
    a) single-apple single-worm
    b) multiple-apples single-worm 
    c) multiple-apple single-worm with unbounded world
    d) multiple-apple multiple-worm with unbounded world

The most valuable thing that the students are going to learn is logic thinking and problem solving: 
    a) build base game with class, function and module
    b) increase complexity step by step
    c) continue testing 



Basic knowledge of computer and programming (e.g., scratch) will be helpful but not necessary. Bringing your laptop and curiosity to the class is required.
